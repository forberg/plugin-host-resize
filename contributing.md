# We would love your contribution!

The best thing is to always file an issue before submitting a pull-request. This is not a requirement, but a general best practice. This makes it easier to discuss the issue before any code is written. Sometimes the issues might already be fixed or will be out of scope for the module.

## Pull requests

* merge all commits into on single commit for the pull request
* do not alter the version number, this is done in the release process
* when adding new features, make sure to add a test for it
* make sure you run all tests to verify nothing broke
	
	$ npm test
